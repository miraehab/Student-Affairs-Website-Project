That is our Project for the Web technologie course taken during fall 2022 semester.

<h2> Website Description</h2>
<h3>This website is for the stuff of the student affairs, each user can :</h3>
1. Add a new student to the system. Student information includes id, name,
date of birth, GPA, gender, level, status=”active”, “inactive”, department, email,
mobile number.</br>
2. Update an existing student information ( except department field should be
shown disabled for editing ).</br>

data page with a confirmation dialogue for the action before deletion occurs.</br>
4. Search for “active” students by name in search for students screen and
students with similar names having active status should be rendered as a table.</br>

the student’s department assignment page.(applicable for students if level >= 3)</br>
